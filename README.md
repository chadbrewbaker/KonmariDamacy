# KonmariDamacy
Spark joy by removing features.



## Layout
We maintain a fork of each project then git submodule our forks in this repo.

## Tools
TODO - run with code coverage to flag unused code for removal. Use shim libc with stack trace logging to annoate IO code coverage. Linter that catches IO functions from libc. Fuzzing/concolic testing to verify nothing broke and IO is still unreachable.
